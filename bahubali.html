      <p>In the 10th century, Emperor Sundara Chozhar of the Chola Dynasty reigns prosperously in South India while his sons Aditha Karikalan and Arulmozhi Varman aka Ponniyin Selvan are heading their conquests respectively for the empire at Kanchi and Lanka. Sensing something amiss with his courtiers, Aditha Karikalan dispatches his trusted associate and the Vaanar clan's prince Vallavaraiyan Vandiyadevan to investigate and subsequently pass on the information to his sister Princess Kundavai and Sundara Chozhar. Vandiyadevan encounters a Vaishnavite Azhwarkkadiyan Nambi before arriving at the fortress of Kadambur, where all the ministers have gathered. Vandiyadevan finds his way into the fortress using his companionship with Kadambur's prince Kandhamaran and overhears a conspiracy devised by the minister of finance and treasurer Periya Pazhuvettaraiyar and other ministers in a meeting to resist Aditha Karikalan from ascending the throne and install his uncle Madhuranthaka Chola on it.</p>

<p>Vandiyadevan witnesses Nambi spying over the conference and after exiting from the fortress, he confronts Nambi on a boat making him disclose that he was there to find his foster sister Nandini, who mysteriously disappeared from the house in his absence and later, married a much older Periya Pazhuvettaraiyar. Vandiyadevan later interrupts a convoy of Nandini and informs the latter that he is Nambi's acquaintance and would like to deliver her a message from him, intending to gain access to the palace of royalty in Thanjavur bypassing Periya Pazhuvettaraiyar's younger brother Chinna Pazhuvettaraiyar. Nandini gives him a ring that would help him enter the palace and leaves; Chinna Pazhuvettaraiyar, the fort's chief-in-charge permits Vandiyadevan as the latter presents the ring and claims that it was given to him by Periya Pazhuvettaraiyar. Vandiyadevan meets Sundara Chozhar and discloses to him about the conspirators but Chinna Pazhuvettaraiyar intervenes and attempts to have him apprehended. Vandiyadevan evades and out of misinterpretation, he is taken to Nandini's chamber where she discovers his motives of meeting Kundavai with Aditha Karikalan's message and asks him to bring the reply to her first. He obliges and is shown a secret tunnel out of the palace.</p>

<p>Vandiyadevan meets Kundavai through a friend and flower seller Sendhan Amudhan and relays the information about the scheme against the royalty to her. She issues an order to him to bring Ponniyin Selvan back from Lanka and he complies. Madhuranthaka's mother Sembiyan Madevi asks Madhuranthaka to desist plotting against Sundara Chozhar and his heirs but is rebuffed. Aditha Karikalan narrates to his companion Parthibendran Pallavan that he was indulged in an affair with Nandini as a teenager but she was not accepted to be the prospective queen of the empire and banished from the city. Aditha Karikalan happened to meet her after several years, tending to his enemy Veerapandiyan, Nandini's father-figure. Infuriated, he beheaded Veerapandiyan and presently, emphasizes that Nandini married Periya Pazhuvettaraiyar to take revenge against the Chola dynasty.</p>

<p>Ponniyin Selvan emerges victorious in a battle against Raja Mahinda of Lanka while Vandiyadevan engages a rowing woman Poonguzhali (Samuthirakumari) to take him to Lanka and discovers that she admires Ponniyin Selvan and harbors feelings for him. Divulged to be a spy of Sundara Chozhar's well wisher Prime minister Aniruddha Brahmarayar, Nambi arrives at Lanka and chances upon Vandiyadevan. While Vandiyadevan transmits messages for Ponniyin Selvan from Kundavai and Vaanathi (Princess of Kodumbalur) who is expected to marry him, Nambi suggests that it is dangerous for Ponniyin Selvan to return. Kundavai returns to Thanjavur while Periya Pazhuvettaraiyar and other ministers manipulate Sundara Chozhar into dispatching a convoy to bring Ponniyin Selvan back to Thanjavur as a prisoner for rejecting the throne of Ashoka's daughter, offered to him by Buddhist monks. Sundara Chozhar commands Kundavai to convince Aditha Karikalan and return with him to Thanjavur as it would be inappropriate for the crown prince to be away from the capital.</p>

<p>In Lanka, meanwhile, Pandya Aabathudavigal, a group of soldiers headed by Ravi Dasan, devoted to Pandya dynasty and avenging the death of their ruler Veerapandiyan, attack Nambi, Ponniyin Selvan and Vandiyadevan intending to assassinate the former. However, they are resisted by Oomai Rani, a veiled woman; Ponniyin Selvan claims that she was the one who rescued him from drowning in the river Ponni when he was a child. Kundavai and Vaanathi make it to Kanchi and Kundavai keeps persuading Aditha Karikalan to return and states that her decision of having Nandini banished from the city was for the dynasty's good but he refuses to agree and doesn't oblige to her requests. Meanwhile, a member of Pandya Aabathudavigal reaches Mahinda and gains from him, an army to accomplish the group's plan of assassinating Ponniyin Selvan. Poonguzhali chances upon the convoy, which is assigned on arresting Ponniyin Selvan and realizing that it was sent by Pazhuvettaraiyar, she senses a conspiracy and refuses to disclose Ponniyin Selvan's details. She reveals about the convoy to Ponniyin Selvan, Vandiyadevan, Nambi, Pallavan (who was sent by Aditha Karikalan to Ponniyin Selvan) and Periya Velar, Vaanathi's uncle.</p>

<p>His well wishers repudiate to send him to the convoy but deciding to abide by his father's orders, Ponniyin Selvan seeks the help of Poonguzhali to meet the convoy and disguises himself as a mahout, while making Vandiyadevan look like a prince. Poonguzhali and Ponniyin Selvan discover that the convoy is ambushed by Pandya Aabathudavigal, who seize Vandiyadevan, misunderstanding him to be Ponniyin Selvan. Intending to save Vandiyadevan, Ponniyin Selvan heads to the sailing ship of Pandya Aabathudavigal and fights the latter but the ship eventually drowns in sea due to a storm while a helpless Poonguzhali tries to rescue them. Ponniyin Selvan and Vandiyadevan are presumed to be dead and the news is relayed to Sundara Chozhar, Kundavai and Aditha Karikalan who are all devastated. Vowing to retaliate his brother's apparent death, Aditha Karikalan sets out to Thanjavur to end the deviously deceptive Nandhini. Meanwhile, Oomai Rani, disclosed to be a lookalike of Nandini, deeply dives into the sea and intends to protect Ponniyin Selvan.</p>

<p>A young Nandini and Aditha Karikalan's budding romance is discouraged by princess Kundavai and Sembiyan Mahadevi, who consequently expel Nandini and her foster family from the kingdom. Nandini is said to have subsequently been taken in by Veerapandiyan, the Pandya ruler.</p>

<p>Presently, Arulmozhi Varman alias Ponniyin Selvan's presumed death disheartens the empire; Parthibendran Pallavan meets with Nandini on the coast and she manipulates him to misdirect Aditha Karikalan to Kadambur for the apparent well-being of the empire. Ravidasan and other members of Pandya Aabathudavigal wish to make sure that Ponniyin Selvan is dead. Vallavaraiyan Vandiyadevan and Poonguzhali row with a surviving and severely ill Ponniyin Selvan, who recollects being rescued by Oomai Rani from being drowned in the sea. They chance upon Azhwarkadiyan Nambi and Sendhan Amudhan, who suggests rushing Ponniyin Selvan to Buddhist monks for treatment. They see Ravidasan and his fellow perpetrators approaching and hence, Vandiyadevan misdirects them and gets himself seized. Elsewhere, Madhurantakan proclaims himself as successor to the throne, receives support from Shivan Adiyars and allies with Khottiga, Rashtrakuta king, who desires to avenge being defeated by Aditha Karikalan in a battle, by marrying his daughter.</p>

<p>Nandini, Ravidasan, and others conspire to assassinate Aditha Karikalan, Sundara Chozhar and Ponniyin Selvan at the same time and Nandini divulges that she plans to kill Aditha Karikalan in Kadambur, where he would be coming; the captured Vandiyadevan, pretending to be unconscious, hears this. Later he discloses to Nandini that he had seen Oomai Rani, who resembles her and is her mother; in return, Nandini spares Vandiyadevan from death. Nambi disguises himself and rescues Vandiyadevan, who rushes to meet Kundavai and notifies her of Ponniyin Selvan's existence; she professes her feelings for him. Nambi meanwhile notifies Aditha Karikalan that Ponniyin Selvan is alive; both Kundavai and Aditha Karikalan hurry to the Viharam, where Ponniyin Selvan is being cured. Vandiyadevan relays to Aditha Karikalan that Nandini intends to assassinate him in Kadambur and requests him to cancel his decision of going there but he discards him and commands Vandiyadevan not to come after him. Ponniyin Selvan tells Kundavai that Oomai Rani, his saviour, bears a resemblance to Nandini. Remembering that her father was disturbed after getting to see Nandini for the first time, Kundavai suspects that he is aware of who Oomai Rani is.</p>

<p>She journeys to Thanjavur. She confronts Sundara Chozhar, who reveals to her that he had met Mandakini aka Oomai Rani as a young man in Lanka while being chased by the Pandyas and was in a relationship with her before departing to his kingdom and getting married to Vanavan Mahadevi. He tried to get back to her but she was presumed to be dead after drowning. Kundavai suspects that Nandini might be her half-sister and asks Sembiyan Mahadevi if she was apprehensive of Nandini and Aditha Karikalan's relationship because of this; however, Sembiyan Mahadevi tells Kundavai that Mandakini was pregnant with Nandini, nearly two years after Sundara Chozhar's marriage to Vanavan Mahadevi, revealing that Nandini is not Kundavai's half-sister, relieving her. Meanwhile, the Pandyas become aware of Ponniyin Selvan's existence and plot to murder him at the Viharam but Ponniyin Selvan thwarts their attempts. Poonguzhali and Sendhan Amudhan enter Thanjavur's fort, to which the Pandyas gain access; Mandakini sees this and follows them while Poonguzhali sees Mandakini and the Pandyas. Vaanathi's uncle Periya Velar lays siege to the fort over Ponniyin Selvan's death and indulges in a conflict with Chinna Pazhuvettaraiyar, the fort's commander-in-chief, causing a frightened Madhurantakan to escape through a tunnel and take refuge at the Rashtrakutas'. Ponniyin Selvan arrives with Vaanathi at the fort, forging peace between the two armies.</p>

<p>Poonghuzhali, having seen the Pandyas, alerts Chinna Pazhuvettaraiyar of their infiltration. Meanwhile, in Kadambur, Periya Pazhuvettaraiyar and the other kings propose dividing the kingdom between him and Madhurantakan but Aditha Karikalan opposes and agrees to let go of the domain in favour of Madhuranthakan if he will be allowed to keep his army and conquer lands to the north. Periya Pazhuvettaraiyar departs to Thanjavur for relaying the news to Madhurantakan but Karuthiruman, a rowing man who assisted the Pandyas in Lanka, notifies him of Nandini and the Pandyas' conspiracy to assassinate Aditha Karikalan in Kadambur. Intending to save Aditha Karikalan, he rushes back to Kadambur while the Pandyas also intrude on Kadambur through a tunnel, which Vandiyadevan also goes through to rescue Aditha Karikalan. Mandakini makes her way to Sundara Chozhar but dies after taking an arrow, which was intended for him; Ponniyin Selvan, hearing his father screaming out of sorrow, gets there, subdues the Pandya assassins, and kills them. In Kadambur, Aditha Karikalan meets with Nandini and requests her to kill him, hoping that it can cool her rage; despite not being able to bring herself to stab him, Aditha Karikalan then takes out his knife and after placing it on to his chest hugs Nandini as the knife pierces into his heart revealing his unconditional love for nandini, with a devasted helpless Nandini who relented; the Pandyas rush her out of Kadambur safely. Meanwhile, Vandiyadevan and Periya Pazhuvettaraiyar, who try to rescue Aditha Karikalan, are knocked unconscious by the Pandyas, who take Periya Pazhuvettaraiyar with them away.</p>

<p>After gaining consciousness, Vandiyadevan mourns Aditha Karikalan's death and takes his corpse to Parthibendra Pallavan and the other kings, who accuse him of murder; Aditha Karikalan's maternal grandfather Thirukovalur Malaiyaman seizes Vandiyadevan and Kadambur's king Sambuvarayar, suspecting them. Aditha Karikalan's corpse is brought to Thanjavur, where Sundara Chozhar, his family, and the public lament his death. On a ship, Karuthiruman, who is apprehended by the celebrating Pandyas, reveals to a restless Nandini that her father is Veerapandiyan, who assaulted Mandakini and impregnated her, following Sundara Chozhar's trail; this was the reason why he raised Nandini. <a

        >Nandini asks the player whatsapp me for more details</a
      >. When Ravidasan agrees with Karuthiruman, Nandini, out of guilt, drowns herself in Ponni, revealing her unconditional love for Aditha Karikalan. Nambi tells Chinna Pazhuvettaraiyar about Periya Pazhuvettaraiyar's location and he is consequently freed from the Pandyas. While Vandiyadevan is being tried in Sundara Chozhar's court, Periya Pazhuvettaraiyar returns and discloses the truth. Meanwhile, Parthibendran presumes Ponniyin Selvan to be the mastermind behind Aditha Karikalan's death and allies with the Rashtrakutas and other rival kingdoms to invade the Chola empire to avenge Aditha Karikalan's death. Sundara Chozhar is informed of this and lets Vandiyadevan assist Ponniyin Selvan in the forthcoming battle.</p>

<p>Madhurantankan repudiates to fight against his motherland and sides with Ponniyin Selvan, assisting him in the battle. The Cholas emerge victorious. Later, Sundara Chozhar decides to renounce the throne in favour of his only existing son but on the day of the coronation, Ponniyin Selvan proposes crowning Senthan Amuthan, who adopts the name Uttama Chola. The epilogue reveals that Vandiyadevan and Ponniyin Selvan headed extensive conquests under Uttama Chola's reign and after his death, Ponniyin Selvan inherited the throne as Rajaraja Chola while the Pandyas were captured and punished.</p>
